Move all vcfs to the same folder (pileup/results). [done]
Get tables from vcfs.
Calculate coverages from BAMs.
Analyze mutation count distributions at particular ADs based on AAF (1%, 2%, 5%, 10%) x Coverage.
Compute Novaseq vs HiSeq chi-square statistics for each mutational category.
Do up heatmap that is 20 x 6 in size (20 samples, 6 categories, colored depending on chi-square statistic).
